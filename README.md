# ember-component-view README

This creates a simple tree view of the open components and all discovered related files for that component.

## Features

This creates a simple tree view of Ember components.  The tree view consists of a top level containing the name of the component, the absolute path, and an icon indicating if the component is core, extended, or shared. The next level down is a list of all files associated with that component, this includes the js and hbs files, as well as all associated tests and the scss stylesheets if they are found.

A component can be opened from the right click menu within the tree view, and closed again from the right click menu on a given component.

Clicking on a given file will open it.

Tests can also be run from the right click menu.  Note that this will set the filter within the pemberly test page, and isn't dependent on if a specific file is found within the codebase.

#### Component View

> A list of all of the found associated files.  Note that multiple stylesheets may be listed if multiple associated ones are found in the engine and a global/common location.

## Requirements

None

## Known Issues

* Doesn't pre-populate the components when first loaded
* Loops through and opens each file in turn when hitting refresh
* May not open all of the components correctly the first time

## Building

In order to build this project you'll need to run 'vsce package'.  More info about that here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/publish-extension

## Outstanding TODOs

* Nest all platforms of a single component so the tree goes: component -> different platforms -> associated files
* Add support for services
* Add support for routes
* Add right click menu to open editors window
* Only show right click menu if recognized component
* Add support for composure phase 2 locations
* Add support for composure phase 4 test locations
* Add ability to lookup from a stylesheet
* Handle special case of shared directory for scss files
* Fix file structure for global stylesheets
* Have a single or double click open the component instead of a right click - make this configurable
* Clean up icons to look like the ones from VS
* Clean up top level icons - add color to light version
* Add save/reload capability on reopen working state
* Add logo for the extension
* Add tests
* Refactor (including splitting treeview from commands)
* Add support for partials - maybe not - they don't have JS associated
* Add ability to mark if a file is found in the wrong location
* Add ability to open a component from right clicking on a test
